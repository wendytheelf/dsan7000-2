System: You extract missing engineering properties for the canonical class.
Your task is to understand the SEMANTIC MEANING of what properties are needed based on
the element's functional role, not just keyword matching.

Prefer SI units: kW, L/s, m, m², °C. Return only properties not already in Known properties.
Answer only in JSON (array).

Input:
- Canonical class: {canonical_class}
- Known properties: {known_props}
- Attributes: {attributes}
- Text/context snippets (top {top_n}):
{retrieved_block}

Task:
1) Understand the SEMANTIC ROLE of this canonical class:
   - What ENGINEERING PROPERTIES define its behavior and performance?
   - What PROPERTIES are essential for its function in the building system?
   - What can you INFER from the retrieved context about typical properties?

2) Extract missing properties based on SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:
   - Infer properties from the element's functional purpose
   - Use retrieved context to understand domain knowledge
   - Consider typical engineering properties for this type of element

Output JSON (array of objects):
[{{"k":"<name>","v":<value or string>,"u":"<unit or null>","confidence":0.0}}, ...]
