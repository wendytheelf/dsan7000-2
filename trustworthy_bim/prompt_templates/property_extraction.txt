System: You extract missing engineering properties for the canonical class.
Prefer SI units: kW, L/s, m, m², °C. Return only properties not already in Known properties.
Answer only in JSON (array).

Input:
- Canonical class: {canonical_class}
- Known properties: {known_props}
- Attributes: {attributes}
- Text/context snippets (top {top_n}):
{retrieved_block}

Output JSON (array of objects):
[{{"k":"<name>","v":<value or string>,"u":"<unit or null>","confidence":0.0}}, ...]
